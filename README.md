# Begining is the End is the begining. 
## Overview 

This course is about coding, design, typography, chats, stresses and a lots of laughers. 

## Reflection

Through this course, I have learnt about JavaScript, in particular p5.js. I have a bit of background of processing Java but that was a while back. Due to the fact that this is a class about typography. Which is one of my favourite community of practices as well. I am really passionate about the class and what I can do with the skills that I have learnt, especially when I can apply them into future interactive basis design like installation. Due to my interests in the subject matter, I have been using what I have learnt from this class to apply to my other classes as well, in particular Capstone. I have used JavaScript to created two of my projects. Although they are not fully driven by coding, but I did use what I have learnt to create some elements and movement in support of my Capstone. I have to admit during this class, there are so many stressful time, especially when working on final assignment, when I am not sure if the coding will work the way I would like it to, also considering when I use library and other scripts online, how could I make it my own and stands out from the others. Another thing I noticed is that I am quite quick when it comes to learning new stuff, in particular technical stuff. But I have to use my design skills to complement the skills, which I could be a bit slow in terms of designing stuff nicely. In the end of the day, technical skills are for the purpose of designing better, not the other way round. Another thing that I have learnt when I reflected on my work is that I seem to focus on the movement of my final product instead of user interaction side of it. I am really inspired by my talented fellow classmates’ works, and realised that there is so many layers of user interactions where audiences can play around with the codes from one stage to the next. I think this is defiantly something that I have to put into consideration when next time I am working on any project. In the end of the day, the purpose of coding is for interaction. If not, why should I use coding instead of my motion skill? What I have learnt from this class not limited only in processing itself, but also the different kind of inspirations that are shared among classmates. Including both visual and content researches. It was indeed an eye opening. One thing that I am really proud of is the first assignment on the interpretation of the minecraft version of House of Leaves’ introduction. I am always a bit fan of films and cinematography. Therefore it really gets me excited and able to pull off something that I am passionate combined with my area of expertise on motion and sound design. about and receive great reviews. I am also grateful of a great team that have been working together who are of same vision and efficient online collaborations.
