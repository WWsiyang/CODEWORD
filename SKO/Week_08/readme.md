### The Time of Digital Poetry: From Object to Event 
*N. Katherine Hayles *

As Cayley (1998b) points out, alphabetic language can be considered a digital structure because it consists of a small symbol set that can be endlessly combined and recombined to produce an infinite number of words and texts. The computer (or, as he prefers to call it, the “programmaton”) is the most conspicuous instance of networked and programmable media (in Cayley’s terms, “npm”) that rely on binary code, but it is by no means the first medium to use digitized language.

## Feedbacks

***the actcidential shaow resulted in the prototype can be applied into final design as a reflection of self*** 

***simplify the narration more***

***generative results-generate a different text/conclusion each time user interract with it***
