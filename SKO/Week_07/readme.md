### The Time of Digital Poetry: From Object to Event 
*N. Katherine Hayles *

I have done my first round of paper prototyping this week. I honestly have no ideas on what is possible and what is not. I simply did this based on my instinct. As my previous design mentor mentioned to me not to think about the technical aspect of things so that my creativities will not be limited. I used how I usually tell a story in design and my motion sense with my tiny little bit of processing knowledge.

I actually selected two different phrases from the article and did two versions based on them.

### 1
>Electronic literature can exploit characteristics, intensifying their effects through reflexive strategies about use the processual nature of electronic texts to create aesthetic experiences unique to digital media.

>These poem- events, similar to the readers they construct and require, are rivers that flow, processes that evolve, materiality that emerge contingently, flickering in the constantly changing plays of meanings.

>As Cayley (1998b) points out, alphabetic language can be considered a digital structure because it consists of a small symbol set that can be endlessly combined and recombined to produce an infinite number of words and texts. The computer (or, as he prefers to call it, the “programmaton”) is the most conspicuous instance of networked and programmable media (in Cayley’s terms, “npm”) that rely on binary code, but it is by no means the first medium to use digitized language.
