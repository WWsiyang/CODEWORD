# It's Premiere Time

## Introduction
This week is mostly about looking at the digital interpretation of *House of Leaves* we have been working on for the past 4 weeks. I have indeed learnt so much from other people's work. And I am very pleased with the amount of efforts our team has been putten into, and the outcome is satisfied. I have to admit I did constantly worry about my VO but it turns out working well in the end.

The way that we have always been working is that on the post production side, we are constantly updating the edit. We had a few edits going on and we share with the group so that group can make comments based on that, and we reshoot some of the shots. Some of the shots over a few times indeed. As Faye and I had sound design experience before. I recorded and worked on Garage Band for the sound and VO design for quite sometime.

During lunch time everyone was celebriting by send each other what we eat. Indeed we not only teammates, but developed further friendship and decided to hang out after the restriction has lifted.
