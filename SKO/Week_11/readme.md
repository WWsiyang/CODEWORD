***code created followed tutorial by Daniel Shiffman with combination code from Yhlas***

Well, think I have just got a misunderstanding on what Karen and Andy said about resize it to half. I have also got feedback these weeks on how I should just keep it simple and make it like black and white for my particle texts. Also that I have to figure out a layout that best suited my work. As everything is here, but need to work on the design. Based on these feedbacks. I have tried this code:

I plan to combine this code and my particle text together, but at the same time also worried that it might be too much going on.

## CapStone GKO

For my GKO, as I am working on an installation prototype with the help of processing and AE. There is a data visualisation on how the amount of nuclear weapons on this planet earth could rebuild the island of Manhattan. I decided to use p5.js help out a bit here.
