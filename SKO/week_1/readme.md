# Begining of a Whole New Journey
## Introduction
This week we got a start go at how the course is structured overall. We learn about the age of digital reading like the one we are at currently. Andy and Karen also introduced us the mindblowing novel *House of Leaves* as well as why we should trust them due to the astonishing experiences they had in the industry. At the same time they told us why we shouldn't trust them as the industry is never stopping revolving and elevating, therefore allowing freedom to ourselves to create another potential milestone.

## Discussion 
In Andy Simionato's own word:
>We actally read more than anytime in the history ever! 

we then broke out into small groups to discuss a long form of texts that we have been reading, during the discussion we have some interesting input and I get to know more about some of the different form of literatures my fellow peers have been into.

I shared the books that I have been reading:

- ***Life of George Washington***
- ***The Design of Everyday Things***

My first experience in Minecraft, although I have heard of the programme many times, it is fun indeed, just do not know how my talented classmates create all sorts of stuff.
