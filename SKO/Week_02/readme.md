# All About Interpretation

## Introduction

Kicked started by introduction of several famous type designers and followed up by dividing into groups again to find and research on the artists we interested in, I am always a big fan of modular typeface. Therefore it is an enjoyable experience, the only fear I have is probably missing out anybody's link.

The artist that I dived into is Ahn Sang-soo. The way he designed Hangeul typography with a modular approach caught my eyes, the best part is about how he applied those design to go beyond a digital space but to a physical space.

Another exciting thing happened after is of course confirming our group of interpretation of *house of leaves* I have to say really exciting team with a lot of enthusiasm. I was undecisive at the start of what platform should I choose, and in the end, I still decided to stay in Minecraft group as I heard there is a lot of room for freedom when comes to building stuff.

we quickly created a facebook group and really looking forward to the first meetup sessions with these lovely people

## Practice 

For homework, I did an edition based on Jamie Tung's alphabet, it is hard to understand everything from the code, but with some researches and playing around, I managed to understand some of it and managed to create something out of it. I manage to have a better understanding of **variables** and **translate** It was fun, and get to know the platform better, I think the most important thing of learning anything new is really about switching my thinking and logic to align with the way the platform thinks, hopefully I could get there someday.
