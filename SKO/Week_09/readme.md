# Coding Process

## What I have Now

1st atempt

[1st attempted coding fading](https://wwsiyang.github.io/CODEWORD/SKO/Week_09/digital_poetry_fadingupdown)

2nd atempt 

[2nd attempted coding shuffle](https://wwsiyang.github.io/CODEWORD/SKO/Week_09/digital_poetry_fading_shuffle_typewrite)

I have the shuffle works for me thanks to Karen, I am able to generate a few text contexts each time and I set the leading to be my mouseX, so it generates interesting result each time. However I still want the different letters to be able to generate different variable texts each time. Right now I do not see the processing of sentence A morph into sentence B. that is eventually what I wanted to achieve. Like this:

[textmorphing](https://editor.p5js.org/tom.smith/sketches/YEEdV1KCF)

the reason for that is due to the text context of transform from one sentenc to another due to:"endlessly combined" to "recombined"

# experimental restults 
I am generally quite happy with these outcomes. They look really interesting and I can see the possibilities of how these can be represented like a traditional typewriting style. However I might use these on some other things. I donâ€™t think I will use these for this project.

## Flow Chart

I simplified my prototye and break down into flow chart of 4 stages: 

1. text fade - 2. combined/recombined - 3. infinite wording - 4. generative text 

***1. text fade***

I have done this code here for now

***2. combine/recombine***

***3.Infinite***

***4.generative outcome: Electronic Literature***

for 2nd and 3rd stage I basically need it my sentence to be able to transform from one sentenc to another: 
"endlessly combined" to "recombined" 

I haven't find the exact library that suits me, but the cloest I got is this one:

[textmorphing](https://editor.p5js.org/tom.smith/sketches/YEEdV1KCF)

and I do have my first part of the code done. Just a very simple fading, but a bit stucked on how to proceed from here. My understanding is that it is probably gonna be different classes invovled. But I am still not sure how could I morph/transit from one to another.
