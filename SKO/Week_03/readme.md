# Generative Text is the New Black

## Introduction
A great way of startint the day by researching on generative texts, electronic literature, animated texts. Had some fun by looking at these references early in the morning.

Found this text generative website showing case type design, it generates different typography and text content up to the user's choice, it also has the function of detecting voice. I definitely realised how important and useful and entertaning generative design really is.

As someone who is very familiar with motion design, I found out this company which does their motion type design pretty well. It is not code basis, but it is defnitely motion type and modular typography

## Practice 

As a group we did meet up and we started to work on common miro board and google doc so that as a team it is easier for us to align our vision for the project, we treated like a film production which we all started from working on script and some of us started to create something inside the Minecraft. As long as that got locked down we started to work on storyboard as well

at each of the scene we discussed through script, we also drop down visual references from films to show the vision we had for each of these scenes, so that we can be at the same page, think we just figure out a great way of doing group project online.

we wanted to have some of these abstract scenes to show the inner world of the character instead of everything be literal and physical. These comes from a conceptual title sequence pitch for the film *Sherlock Homes*, but of course this one is for pitching, the artists' works did not make it to the big screen, but I think this deserves to be in the cinema
